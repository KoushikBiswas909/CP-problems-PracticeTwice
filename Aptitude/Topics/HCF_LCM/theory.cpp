/* **********Highest Common Factor and Lowest Common Multiple (HCF & LCM)***********

******* Calculate LCM ********
1.
 LCM: 2|4,8,6
        -----
       2|2,4,3
         -----
         1,2,3
    Now LCM= 2×2×1×2×3 = 24
2. So what is doing internally, let's assume LCM(9,12)
Ans: So multiples of 9: 9×18×27×36×45×54
     So multiples of 12: 12×24×36×48×60

     now here Lowest Common multiple is 36, So LCM(9,12)=36.


******* Calculate HCF ********
1.
HCF: 3|6,9,12
       ------
       2,3,4

       now see 2 & 4 can be divided by 2, but we can do it for LCM, NOT HCF.
       Now, HCF of 6,9,12 is 3.

2. So what is going internally,
Ans: Prime Factorization of 6: 1×2×3×6
     Prime Factorization of 9: 1×3×9
     Prime Factorization of 12: 1×2×3×4×6×12

     Now check Highest Prime Factor common in all casees is 3.
     So, HCF(6,9,12)=3
