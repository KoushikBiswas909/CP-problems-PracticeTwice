*************************  Introduction  ********************************

•Think quietly One problem has Multiple solutions, but there are always a constraints,
So those problems comes under constraints call -> *Feasible Solutions*.
•But Feasible solutions can be multiple number.
•Now from the feasible solutions if you have to choose max or min optimized solutions,
then the problem is called *Optimized Problem*
•Optimized Problems can be solved by 3 methods:
   1. Greedy Method
   2. Dynamic Programming
   3. Branch and Bound Method


**************************   Greedy Algorithms  ***************************

Greedy algorithms work in stages. In each stage, a decision is made that is good at that point,
without bothering about the future. 

**************************   Greedy Applications  *************************

• Sorting: Selection sort, Topological sort
• Priority Queues: Heap sort
• Huffman coding compression algorithm
• Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms
• Shortest path in Weighted Graph [Dijkstra’s]
• Coin change problem
• Fractional Knapsack problem
• Disjoint sets-UNION by size and UNION by height (or rank)
• Job scheduling algorithm
• Greedy techniques can be used as an approximation algorithm for complex problems

************************  Huffman Coding Algorithm  **********************

I understand the thing write algo in book this pic in repo.
Didnot code it caz i don't know some priority queue
Theory from- Abdul Bari
Algo from- Git repo & Narasimha

************************  Job Scheduling Problem  **********************
