Advantages of waterfall Model:
1.Basic Model
2.Simple and easy
3.Small project can only implemented by this.

Disadvantages of waterfall Model:
1. No feed back in all phase
2.No experiment in all phase
3.No parallelism, when one team works, others are free.
4.High risk
5.60% efforts in Maintanance phase.


**** Iterative Waterfall Model ****

The main deference is Feedback Method.
